# DSA

## Contents

This folder contains Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice code and solutions.

### Implemented Programs

- **Postfix Expression Evaluation**
  - C++ program to evaluate postfix expressions using a stack.
  - Supports single-digit and multi-digit numbers (with space-separated input).
  - Handles operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`.
  - Includes error handling for invalid expressions and division by zero.

## Usage

- For postfix evaluation, compile and run `evaluation_of_postfix.cpp`.
- Enter the postfix expression with spaces between numbers and operators (e.g., `12 3 4 * +`).
